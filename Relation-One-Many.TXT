GenerationType.AUTO     -> pick an aprropriate strategy for the particular database
GenerationType.IDENTITY-> assign primary keys using database identity column -> Most  use for autoicremental
GenerationType.SEQUENCE -> Assign primary keys using a database sequence
GenerationType.TABLE -> assign primary keys using an underlying database table to ensure uniqueness

Default Fetch Types
@OneToOne FetchType.EAGER
@OneToMany FetchType.LAZY
@ManyToOne FetchType.EAGER
@ManyToMany FetchType.LAZY

we can use HQL (It's sql with hibernate )
 // get courses for a given instructor
            Query<Course> query = session.createQuery("select c from Course c "
                                                    + "where c.instructor.id=:theInstructorId",    
                                                    Course.class);
            
            query.setParameter("theInstructorId", theId);
            
            List<Course> tempCourses = query.getResultList();
            
            System.out.println("tempCourses: " + tempCourses);


this is a example to use the query 
@Component
class SomeComponent {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;
    
    public List<SomeEntity> findAllEntities() {
        TypedQuery<SomeEntity> query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT e FROM SomeEntity e", SomeEntity.class);
        return query.getResultList();
    }
}

The query is EAGER


@JoinColum ... where does it find the column?

Question

In the Course class,we have OneToMany relation with reviews with join column course_id.

But in course table we do not have column course_id.

Ideally when we say @JoinColumn a new column should be created in course table ... isn't it?

How does @JoinColum know where to find the join column?

---

Answer

The JoinColumn is actually fairly complex and it goes through a number of advanced steps to find the desired column.

This info below is from the documentation

Source: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/JoinColumn.html#name--

---

The table in which it is found depends upon the context.

- If the join is for a OneToOne or ManyToOne mapping using a foreign key mapping strategy, the foreign key column is in the table of the source entity or embeddable.

- If the join is for a unidirectional OneToMany mapping using a foreign key mapping strategy, the foreign key is in the table of the target entity.

- If the join is for a ManyToMany mapping or for a OneToOne or bidirectional ManyToOne/OneToMany mapping using a join table, the foreign key is in a join table.

- If the join is for an element collection, the foreign key is in a collection table.

So as you can see, it depends on the context.

In our training video, we are using @OneToMany uni-directional (course has one-to-many reviews).

As a result, the join column / foreign key column is in the target entity. In this case, the target entity is the Review class. So, you will find the join column "course_id" in the "review" table.
