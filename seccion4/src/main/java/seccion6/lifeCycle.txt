container Started -> Bean Instantiated -> Dependencies Injected -> Internal Spring Processing -> your Custom Init Method 
Bean is Ready for use 
Container is shtdown -> your Custom Destroy method -> stop

--> You can add custom code during bean Initialization.
--> You can add custom code during bean destruction



ALL THE SCOPE HAVE THE METHOD INIT AND DESTROY BUT THE SCOPE PROPERTY DOESN'T HAVE THE METHOD DESTROY IN THIS CASE I HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERFACE  DisposableBean (Interface internal of spring)
with this, I only have to use the init-method in the xml and when it's destroyed the disposableBean call the destroy ;)
